<p>
<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:<br>
</p>

<p class="indent">The undersigned, an American citizen, respectfully
petitions your honorable body, and prays
that measures may be immediately taken for the
re-establishment of <em>Negro</em> slavery in the States
from which it has just been ejected, and also for its
establishment by law in all the other States and
Territories, of our federal Union; and in support of
his petition, he herewith submits the following</p>


<p class="center no-indent">MEMORIAL.</p>

<p>He is by no means insensible of the opposition he
is likely to encounter at the hands of the half-learned,
the vain and the vicious; but as the roar
of the battle no longer drowns the voice of reason,
he expects to be heard, and when heard to be respected,
and his policy sooner or later adopted. The
tempest, he is also aware, still sweeps on in its old
direction; but the bending forest is beginning to rise,
light to break, and when it comes, in that serenity
which follows the storm, he looks for the calm and
candid judgment, not of the vicious, but of the
patriotic people of his nation.</p>

<p>At the foundation of all polities there are principles—equality
at the basis of democracy, and inequality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
at the basis of all other systems. But whatever
may be the propriety or impropriety of either, all
human laws to be wholesome must conform to the
laws of nature. From these there can be no variance
without harm, therefore is it incumbent on the
statesman, who is of necessity a philosopher, to study
nature, and to conform all his policy to her demands.
Her star is the polar star of all wise legislation, but
from it you have turned aside, and inclined your
ears to the siren songs of countries beyond the
seas until you are transformed into beasts, and become
the destroyers of your own kindred and kind.
You have joined your enemies in their false cry of
<em>liberty</em>—a device invented for your ruin; and in
your delusion have assumed, as self-evidently true,
propositions which are as self-evidently false. You
have assumed a general equality of all the human
races, and the equal adaptability of all localities to
their propagation and development. These are both
false, and in their falsity is to be found the great
volume of that disorder which has converted our
States into antagonisms, drawn the sword of the
father upon the son, sent a million of our young men
to untimely graves, and burdened the living with a
national debt which is, even now, grinding them into
the ground.</p>

<p>The superiority of mankind, we readily concede,
is not determined by shades and shadows; the standard
is much higher. But as mind conforms to matter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
or matter to mind, mentalities are as diversified
as are the shades and colors of human skins. The
exterior is but an index of the interior, or life within;
consequently, as exteriors differ, so do interiors, and
as gradation rises, so do equalities disappear, as the
sage, and all intermediate ascendencies, rise above the
fool. But nature rises by degrees, and, in the harmony
of her adjustments, divides and subdivides her
divisions, as by the walls of a prison, from which
there can be no escape. She has classified her works
into <em>orders</em>, <em>genera</em> and <em>species</em>, and to each fixed a
boundary as immutable as are the stars and the hills.
Education may improve, but it never can pass the
<em>specific</em> or <em>generic</em> barriers which nature has erected
through all her works.</p>

<p>The dog which is a <em>genus</em>, ranked in the world of
letters as the genus <em>canis</em>, has his <em>specific</em> divisions,
as hound, bull, cur, terrier, and the like—each
marked by a peculiarity designating its kind. These
may be cultivated, but never changed or overcome.
The dog that runs by scent may be cultivated in his
powers—may be taught to scent closer and to increase
his speed; so, too, may he that runs by
sight be improved in the same manner; but neither
one can be transformed into the other, for the specific
division must continue to the end of time.</p>

<p>These laws apply with no greater power to inferior
than to superior natures—are no more forcible
on the beast than on the man; but, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
as all nature is divided, the cat, the dog, the horse,
the sheep, the goat, the ox and the swine, each into
his specific kind, so, too, is divided the <em>Genus Homo</em>,
or genus man.</p>

<p>The number of species of this <em>genus</em>—the crowning
ultimate of animated things—may, in the present
condition of our knowledge, be very imperfectly,
if at all, determined. But enough is known to give
us, at least, seven varieties of men—the Mongolian,
the Malay, the Australian, the Indian, the Arctic,
the Negro and the Caucasian—whose divisions are
as well marked as the divisions which separate the
spaniel from the hound, the tiger from the leopard,
or the panther from the cat. Their variances are
all diversified, are physical, mental and instinctive,
and creative of different wants, so that as one spaniel
seeks the water while another shuns it, so do the
various species of men require different rules and
forms, privileges and restrictions, for the regulation
of their aggregation in associated life.</p>

<p>The American Indian shuns the cultivated field
and populous city, and clings to his native forest.
There, though his fare be humble, all the other wants
of his nature are best supplied. Thus do his
instincts act to their end. He finds a restraint in
civilization which drives him to the forest, as heat
drives the whale and the walrus to polar seas. This
instinct is the opposite of the Caucasian’s, and, as
a consequence, points to a specific line. It is fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
in nature, and there must forever remain.
Could it be overcome, the vast tribes who once occupied
our country would not now be numbered with
the past, but would be with us still in the character
of civilized men.</p>

<p>Instincts mark the specific divisions with unerring
certainty, but mentalities are equally patent to the
observing mind. The Indian’s instinct contents him
with his wigwam, but look to the outshoots of his
mentality, and you will find the division between
him and the Caucasian equally marked and legible.
His man-of-war is a bark canoe; his artillery, a bow
and arrow; and his capitol of state, the limbs of the
forest which overhang the smoldering fire around
which his chiefs assemble in council. What but an
inferiority of mentality, coupled with a peculiarity
of instinct, divides him thus from the loftier outshoots
of the Caucasian mind? And as the division
is fundamental, why is it not specific?</p>

<p>The Malay alone runs a muck. Why does he do
so, if there be not implanted in his nature a latent
madness which belongs to no other division of man?
And as it so exists as a peculiarity, does it not mark
a specific division as effectually as does the scent of
one hound divide him from the sighting proclivities
of another?</p>

<p>But let us not linger in discussion on either the
Indian or Malay nature; but, in the emergency of
time, turn to that division of man, which, with reference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
to your long and unceasing disquisitions, has
been termed, and by no means inappropriately, the
“Eternal Negro.”</p>

<p>He is the opposite of the white man in color, and,
as we shall presently see, alike so in instinct and
turn of mind. He also differs from the Indian, for,
unlike him, he does not seek an exclusive independence,
but inclines to the presence of his opposite
race—the white man. He seeks it by choice, and
wheresoever found with it, no matter what may be
his condition before the law, equal or unequal, he
will be found menial and of secondary rank. He will
brush his hair, groom his horse, wait on his stables,
dust his coat, and black his boots, and when held as
a slave, will value himself, not by his own, but by
his master’s worth. Why is this so, if nature does
not give the disposition?</p>

<p>His brain is from ten to fifteen per cent. smaller
than the Caucasian’s, and, at the same time, darker
colored and differently disposed. His back brain,
or cerebellum, is comparatively larger, while his fore
brain, or cerebrum, the organ of thought, is much
smaller. Thus is he inferior as well as differently
molded in the organ of mind. Why, then, is he not
below the white man in the scale of being, and designed
by nature for a secondary rank in the great
work assigned to man of “subduing the world?”</p>

<p>He is inferior as a mental being. But though
less endowed in one particular, is higher favored in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
another; for, while his brain is smaller, his nervous
system is larger, and, as a consequence, stronger.
This gives him power where the white man not unfrequently
fails. But it is a power which comes
with greatest adaptability to his condition as a slave:
for it fortifies him against the wounds of reproof,
and aids his inferior mentality in overcoming the
sting of degradation under which the white man
pines when subjected to the lash.</p>

<p>Other properties of a defensive nature pertain to
him in a similar way. He shows his keeping as
does a horse, an ox or an ass. If he be well fed, he
will be sleek, black, and glossy; but if ill fed, he will
be of a dull, dirty or ashy color. Thus is he defended,
for in this peculiarity of his nature is there
a secret monitor telling the world of a master’s care
or of a master’s neglect.</p>

<p>But returning from properties to structure, we
find his feet larger and flatter than the white man’s,
his arms longer, his head rounder, his lips thicker,
his nose flatter, and his eyes smaller; and what is
equally a mark of specific nature, we find his eyes
and his hair, with its kinks, always of the same
color—invariably black. These are marks of his
being. But in descending the stream of reproduction,
an even more important peculiarity is displayed
in transmission. All of his offspring partake, in
exact proportions, of these general characteristics.
They are all black eyed and black haired—rigidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
so fixed in nature. But no such uniformity follows
the reproduction of the white man. On the contrary,
his children are never exact copies of himself,
nor, like beans, <em>fac-similes</em> of one another, but vary
throughout—in the color of their hair and their
eyes, and in the different shades and tinges of their
complexions.</p>

<p>These peculiarities not only mark specific lines,
but greatly widen the divisions by the properties
which are found pertaining to them.</p>

<p>It is by these properties—the variability on the
one hand, and non-variability on the other—that
men of science have classified animated things into
improvable and non-improvable species. Those unchangeable
in reproduction, as the lion, the tiger, the
leopard and the bear, who partake in exact proportions
of the stripes, and spots, and colors of their
progenitors, are assigned to the division of non-improvables,
while the horse, the dog and the ox,
who vary their colors in reproduction, are assigned
to the division of improvable things.</p>

<p>The non-improvable are also non-progressive,
consequently, as the negro falls within that division,
he must be assigned to the non-progressive department
of animated beings.</p>

<p>But how far the rule is general, we do not pretend
to know, but apprehend that, like most other
rules, it is subject to exceptions. Still, there can
be no difficulty in perceiving that the little dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
eyes, bullet head and inexpressive countenance of
the negro are not the accompaniments of high
mental unfoldings, nor is it likely that civilization,
though forced into the mind, could long be retained
when all these characteristics of inferiority are regularly
transmitted in reproduction. By the constant
power of tuition he may be forced to a particular
limit, but, like the soft magnet, he lapses into
his native condition whenever the charging power
is withdrawn.</p>

<p>In his native country his mentality, like a heavy
fluid, has scarcely, if ever, presented a ripple. Does
not this point to a non-progressive nature? The
same sun which has risen and set upon the white
man, has also, with the same brilliancy shone upon
him, and for precisely the same number of revolving
years. Why, then, has he remained so far below
the white man, if he be not of an inferior species?</p>

<p>By the flow may we determine the character of
the fountain; and, as governments and laws are the
outshoots of the minds which make them, by such
productions may normal status be determined.
“Show me your laws,” said a philosopher, “and I
will tell you what you are.” Show me that you
have no laws, and the rule will apply with equal
force and precision, for then you prove yourself a
barbarian. By this rule then, as well as by any
other, let the negro be measured.</p>

<p>All Africa, under the dominion of the negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
mind—from the desert to the cape—with her fifty
to a hundred millions of people, is a country of
masters and slaves, nailed down by nature to the
lowest possible level of barbarian life. Men, women
and children mingle together in unbroken nudity,
bask in their sands, feed on bugs and reptiles,
and even on the flesh of one another. The men
strut as warriors, though slaves to petty princes,
and the women bend to their lots as bearers of burdens.
Are these nature’s arguments in favor of negro
with white equality before the law!</p>

<p>With all these facts before us, it is scarcely possible
for us to conceive of any two species of the
same genus being more opposite to each other than
the white man and the negro. But men, educated
to a religious belief of a common origin, will cling
to it, and on it form theories of restorable natures,
in spite of the most commanding evidences which,
in every way, thicken around them. Cain’s wife
may or may not have been of the seed of Adam.
But whether she was or was not, or of a different
species, is a subject of but little consequence to us
in the present time, for we have to deal with things,
not as they were, nor as they may have been, but as
we actually now find them in being.</p>

<p>No common type of this great genus, man, has
ever been produced by either change of climate or
country, nor by cross in reproduction. But, on the
contrary, amalgamation is found to be the down-hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
to the grave of all the species. The American Indian
has disappeared by the operation of many
causes, but none other have been so fatal as the intermingling
of his blood with the Caucasian’s. The
mulatto, or mule man, of the black and white cross,
also travels downward, and soon disappears, if not
reinforced with pure blood from one or the other
species. “He will not,” says a learned American
writer, “reproduce after the third remove from the
original unity.” Consequently, if the rule be unexceptionable,
a mulatto, in the fourth remove, unaided
by an intervening black or white parent, does
not exist upon the whole face of the world. Why
should not such propositions be investigated, and
facts determined, before a country is torn to atoms
by a madness built on the assumption of universal
equality, without regard to race or species? But
men seeking power through deception—the churchman
seeking dominion over other sects—the tory,
the ascendency of the British crown—the half-starved
politician, the spoils of office—the vain, a
strap or two of tinsel, and the covetous trader, the
plunder of a camp—may find negro equality as convenient
as any other device.</p>

<p>But you proclaim an age of progress, and dignify
folly with the name of an experiment—an ideal
pomp around which has ever clustered the frivolous
and the vain. But do you not know that experiments
are far more common with the ignorant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
than with the learned? They experiment because
they know not of the experiments which have gone
before them.</p>

<p>Africa is as old as Europe, Asia or America—her
days as bright, her years as long, and her seasons
as refreshing. Why, then, does she linger behind
them? They educated themselves; why has she
not also done like them? If her children be claiming
an equality before the law, should they not be
required to show us their equality behind it?</p>

<p>But you are trying, you tell us, an experiment—a
point which we concede as readily as you offer it.
But in what way are you trying? You are experimenting
with the circle of darkness drawn close up
around you; for in that darkness, beyond your
vision, every experiment which you are attempting
has been tried a hundred, and possibly a thousand,
times before.</p>

<p>For almost countless centuries, in the high antiquity
of the past—as is now shown by monumental
Egypt—the negro mingled with the people of the
Nile; but was then, as he has ever since been, until
madness overthrew modest nature, the slave of a
higher order of men.</p>

<p>Rome, at a remove of not less than three thousand
years further down the stream of time, and two
thousand above the period on which we now stand,
also sought his elevation—bore him to the land of
the learned; but failed, as all others failed, both before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and since, to force the light of civilization and
self-supremacy through the thick skull which encompassed
his little brain.</p>

<p>The Moors, also, midway between the Romans
and the English theorists and their American apes,
bore him in triumph to conquered Spain; but failed,
as all others failed, to crowd him a single round further
up the ladder of light.</p>

<p>Here reason would have been content. But darkness
again drew her circle in contraction around the
European mind—shut out the light of history—and,
accordingly, a new brood of “experimenters” revived
the old struggle with patient old Nature’s
laws. A religious change had come upon the world,
and, as living gods are always more powerful than
dead ones, Africa, it was conceived, could be moved
by the power of the Cross, where Isis burned her
fires in despair, and Jove’s thunders fell harmless at
the negro’s feet. Accordingly Portugal, about four
centuries ago—then wild with the pomp of a fancied
greatness, and stimulated with papal attention (a
bull from Pope Martin V)—dashed forth in what she
vainly conceived to be a new enterprise in the affairs
of the world. It may, in its origin, have been the
outshoot of philanthropic desire, but in its continuance,
like all other movements of its kindred,
swelled with the impulses of fanatical thought, and
grew in its energy with the emotions which ultimately
gave it force. Expedition after expedition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
was sent forth—missionaries provided, salaried and
commissioned, and “school-marms” drawn from Lisbon,
as they are now drawn from the “Hub of the
Universe,” to teach the negro idea how to shoot.
But, after a long and determined effort, nature over
vanity prevailed. African mentality still clung to
its old level—instincts ran in their old channels;
the white man died, or returned to his native Europe,
and all that now remains of the gigantic enterprise
are a few moldering ruins, overgrown with
brambles, yet to be seen near the mouth of the
Congo river.</p>

<p>This, with the wise, would also have determined
the measure of might. But, in the variation of
creeds and changing dominion of sects, other experimenters
also arose, and pressed on in the same display
of fancies. Protestant England must needs be
as energetic as her Catholic mother, and, in the
pomp of an equal vanity, must needs toss her lances
into the same mountain. Accordingly the old struggle,
under new phases, was again begun, and, through
changes, cessations and variations, continued down
even to the present time. But, notwithstanding so
powerful and continued a struggle, running through
three centuries from its beginning, the negro continues
to-day as the worshipers of Osiris, on the
Nile, fifty centuries ago, found him in his native
jungles. He is still a barbarian—runs in his nakedness,
feeds on human flesh, worships reptiles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and dignifies the funerals of his princes with the
wholesale slaughter of subjects or slaves.</p>

<p>In the first half of the Protestant struggle many
enterprises rose and fell, leaving scarcely a shadow
behind them. But the one most gigantic—aided by
Church and State, and intended not only to civilize,
but to anglicise the negro and his continent—has
left, like the Catholic effort on the Congo, a few moldering
ruins yet to be seen near the mouth of the
Niger; but all else has drifted away with the winds.
Thus did experiment succeed experiment, and failure
succeed failure, until the mind of the learned
sickened, while the ignorant as successively thought
of experimenting again.</p>

<p>But men of thought finally faltered and reflected,
and though they reasoned from various points of
view, ultimately united in assuming that nature had
not created the negro without at the same time
coupling his being with a design. But no design
was tangible until the American plantations called
for laborers, and the negro was found fitted for the
demand. Then opened there, upon the minds of
civilized nations, a secret which until then had been
wrapped up among the mysteries of the world. It
was then seen that the negro as a slave, and the
white man as a master, could be united for each
other’s good. Consequently a commerce was opened
with the African coast, and all Christendom united
in commending and approving the trade. A new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
era thus opened, and all the world said, Amen! But
European kings were not then troubled with a republic
which, for their own safety, they deemed it
best to destroy, nor were white slaves at home controlled
by fixing their attentions on black slaves
abroad. Interests were different. Europe owned
America, and sought its welfare. England was
not then an enemy, nor was there a tory party on
this side of the water, crushed by a revolution,
struggling for resurrection and re-establishment in
power.</p>

<p>The slave trade thus encouraged grew into vast
proportions, and, by its expansion and appendages
of cruelty, swelled from a propriety into a withering
curse. But taken as a whole, it has been productive
of great good. It civilized America, subdued the
forest, and built up the best as well as the last system
of civilization which has yet appeared upon the
world. The best, because the most harmonious and
nearest in conformity to the requisitions of nature’s
laws—a system, which, by force of individual capital,
existing in slaves, makes population rural, draws
it from cities, and plants it upon fields—a system,
which scatters concentrated vice and to which poorhouses
and penitentiaries are but little known.</p>

<p>This was the system under which America rose
and flourished, and through which she commanded
the respect and admiration of the world. But as
the Genius of evil wandered up and down, his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
fell upon “my servant Job,” and—permitted to torture—he
belched forth, in deep, grinding hatred, his
mighty volumes of dark and malignant spite. He
first planted his batteries at a great distance, and
masked them in artful disguise. He commenced in
an English pulpit, in the name of philanthropy, and
from thence spread his fire through kings and
nobles, and by degrees to commoners, until finally
reaching the tory mind of America, he let forth the
full volumes of his hate and his crushing powers,
until he saw the blood of the nation gushing from a
million of streams, and liberty weltering and struggling
beneath the grinding weight of an insurmountable
national debt. Thus has America fallen and
her enemies triumphed through deception and
design.</p>

<p>Experiments were numerous abroad, but had not
the circle of darkness crowded up to the very tips
of your noses, you would see that the experiment
which you are trying, or at least pretending to try,
had already been tried, and its vanity proved within
the reach of your own hands, and at the very stoops
of your own doors. The Eastern and Middle States,
of the Union, in a spirit of mistaken philanthropy,
about the close of the revolutionary war, emancipated,
or rather turned their negroes loose without
masters to direct them in life. Such was the action.
What, then, has been the result? It is simply this:
that not one of those emancipated people is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
alive upon the world; nor have they—if the sphere of
our own observations be an index of the whole—left
a progeny equal to one tenth of their own numbers.
They have died out under a mistaken liberty, while
the slaves of the South have greatly outrun the
multiplication of their white masters. Is this the
millennium with which your experiment is to bless
the negro?</p>

<p>You can answer the question yourselves by
simply citing us to the wants of your Freedmen’s
Bureau—to the mortality among the negroes—and
to such scenes as that of Memphis in the winter
of 1863, when four hundred out of forty thousand
contrabands were daily consigned to “hospitable
graves.”</p>

<p>Malpractice may be covered by a shroud, and the
remains of African experiments overgrown with
brambles; but such stupendous monuments of folly
or of spite, or ulterior design, are not easily overlooked
by men not interested in keeping them from
public view. The negro you have started on a rapid
down-hill march to the grave, and will so find his
movement written in every succeeding census that
will hereafter be taken in the United States. But
let us turn from your follies to your sum of excuses.</p>

<p>You have done all, if your own words may be
taken as expressive of your intentions, for the sake
of that <em>beau ideal</em> of the world called civil or political
liberty. But have you ever stopped in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
career long enough to ask yourselves what such
liberty is?</p>

<p>The German radical sees it only in equality, the
toper in his drams, the brigand in his plunder, and
even Mr. Wendell Phillips, whom you have followed
as the sheep with the bell, has displayed but little,
if any, more wisdom in his definitions. It is, he
tells us, “The reservation of all natural rights with
civil liberty to defend them.”</p>

<p>Could inconsistency be more complete? If all
natural rights be retained, from whence come the
civil ones? Of what materials are they made? If
my natural rights be undisturbed, by what authority
am I crowded from the fields of my neighbor? Did
nature give him more dominion over them than she
gave to me? Or, if the proposition be not as
empty as the air on which it floated, by what authority
did the United States government wage that
war against the Southern States, for the support of
which Mr. Phillips was even then, while making the
utterance, haranguing the people? Did not the
government assume that the Southern people had
surrendered certain <em>natural rights</em>, which they could
not, at pleasure, resume?</p>

<p>Sir William Blackstone, whose views have stood
the abrasion of time with as much durability as any
other of his fellow contributors, discusses the subject
with as much clearness and precision as is, we
apprehend, in any other place to be found. He divides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
the subject into three heads, and to each gives
particular bounds—into absolute liberty, natural
liberty, and that division which is called civil or
political liberty.</p>

<p>The first—absolute liberty—he tells us is “The
power of one to do whatever he sees fit.”</p>

<p>The second—natural liberty—is “The power of
one to do whatever he sees fit to do, subject only
to the laws of nature,” and the third and last—civil
liberty—is “Natural liberty so far restrained,
and no farther than is essential for the public good.”</p>

<p>The first of these, it will no doubt readily be
seen, can have no existence below him to whom
all things move by command. For none other can
do whatever he sees fit to do, consequently such
liberty has no existence in the world of men.</p>

<p>But natural liberty—the power of one to do whatever
he sees fit to do, subject only to the laws of
nature—may have an existence, as by a man placed
alone on a mountain, in a desert, or, like Selkirk, on
an island in the ocean, for then, there are none his
rights to dispute. But as man is a being of many
wants, which he can not himself supply, such liberty
is possibly the most grievous of all oppressions.</p>

<p>From such liberty man flees to a state of society,
and, in doing so, surrenders a portion of his natural
rights that he may secure and enjoy others. This
state, we concede, when natural liberty is so far restrained
and no farther than is just essential, etc., is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
civil liberty. But what amount of restraint is just
so essential is the great practical problem, at the
very beginning of which the commentator’s theory
ends. Settle this, and in the language of “great
Cesar,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">“Our toils may cease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sword be sheathed, and earth be blessed with peace.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But how will you settle it by declaring unequals in
nature, equals by force of law?</p>

<p>The problem, by your theory of a general equality
of the <em>genus homo</em>, ignoring the distinction of
races, can not be solved, nor can peace and happiness
return to the nation while legislation and nature
are at war. You must concede the division of
inequality of species, and upon that division frame
your laws. Then may true civil liberty be assigned
to all.</p>

<p>Nature, though our greatest friend, is, at the
same time, our greatest oppressor; for she keeps
us in a constant struggle for life. We must be fed,
and clothed, and sheltered, and, to be happy, must
have many other wants supplied. To secure these
we retreat into society, throw off native rights, and
continue our retreat until we find the point at which
our wants are best supplied. When we have done
this, then have we found the true measure of our
civil liberty. But, as species differ, both in their
abilities and in their instincts, no two find their measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
at the same point, but are scattered all along
the line from the lowest to the highest endowment
of intellectual man. The white man, in obedience
to the demands of his own nature, must reserve dominion
over himself, for the moment he surrenders it,
he loses his liberty. But it is not so with the negro,
for he is differently endowed, and a being of different
wants. Where the white man’s nature craves
for dominion, his craves for protection, and as that
point is not attained short of an absolute surrender,
he gives up self-dominion that he may receive, in
return, that shelter which his nature desires. When
this is done—when he has made the surrender and
secured the protection, then has he attained to his
time measure of civil liberty: then his cares of the
future are thrown upon his master, and, as a consequence,
he can sing, and dance, and chatter, regardless
alike of what is or is to be, and live out his life
in accordance with his own nature. Thus his civil
liberty and the civil liberty of the white man are as
opposite as are the colors of their skins. One man
is a being dominant and commanding; the other inferior
and subordinate, and by this opposition do
they harmonize in civil life. One supplies what the
other wants; one thinks and directs, the other labors
and obeys, and, as a consequence, the circle is complete.
If one gets hands to do his physical labor,
the other gets a mind, superior to his own, for his
care and protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>The negro, as a slave, is contented with his lot,
and, under it, is the <em>freest</em> as well as the happiest
man in the world; for he is freed from the cares of
life, and particularly from the cares of state, which,
on the civilized plane, he has ever found himself unable
successfully to manage.</p>

<p>His subordination as a race of man pertains to
him alone; and yet we have a very marked parallel
within the very limits of our own species. We are
males and females; but to the male alone belongs
the desire of dominion. Our women reject the right
of suffrage and official position in the state. They
do not want to be voters, or legislators, or officers in
command, nor do they even want the position of
suitors in our courts of law; because such rights to
them are burdens, therefore do they reject them, and
find their civil liberty, not by accepting, but by rejecting
those very rights which alone make their
husbands freemen. Why is this so? It is because,
in nature, the woman is subordinate to the man, as
is also the negro to the Caucasian species.</p>

<p>This is almost a parallel case. The woman has
not the rights which make the man free. But does
this make her a slave? If it does, then is her slavery
just what her nature requires.</p>

<p>The “woman’s-rights man” sees this parallel, and
very properly concludes that if the negro be oppressed
by a deprivation of political rights, the
woman, whose very existence, both political and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
legal, is merged in that of her husband, can be none
the less so. Here we must approve his arguments,
and, with him, censure the abolitionist for inconsistency
who is not also a woman’s-rights man; for if
the negro be enslaved by being relieved of rights
which to him are burdens, why is not the woman
equally a slave who is, in the same way, excluded.
His logic, from his premises, is, we think, unanswerable.
But he does not seem to have discovered that
different natures require different rules, limits and
extensions for the attainment of proper civil status
in society. When he discovers this, he may find, as
others have found before him, that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Concerning man, “though wrangle e’er so long,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis only this, if Heaven hath made him wrong.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here, for the present, we take our leave of the
negro, and turn our attention more directly to that
loftier shoot of humanity, who, for a name, applicable
alike to the whole of a general division—to the
blue-eyed Teuton as well as to the black-eyed Arab—we
have (in obedience to the classification of others)
called the Caucasian.</p>

<p>He is a native of Western Asia, Northern Africa,
and of the whole of Europe, and, within these limits,
flourishes to a native fullness, and multiplies with a
profusion which is now forcing his children out upon
all the world. But the problem of his like success
in other localities yet remains to be solved. Will he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
multiply and continue, on this continent, as he multiplies
and continues on his own?</p>

<p>The Aztecs are already gone. The builders of
our ancient American monuments (supposed to have
been of our own race) unknown—gone probably
through a decline, from causes which may still be
cropping out. But the Caucasian is here master,
as he is wherever else he moves upon the world. But
he is not here actually native, for nature did not
here place him at first. Why this exclusion, we may
never know; or why the red-man of the forest was
assigned to the continent long hid in the western
seas. But if it be held that all men sprung from a
common <em>progenitor</em>, and that countries and climates
have divided them into races or species, why, then,
are we not now in a transition from the Caucasian
to the Indian? But as no such tendency is apparent,
and our sphere of action is limited to things,
not as they were, or as they may have been, but to
that form in which we now actually find them, we need
not linger on probabilities so remote and indefinable.
Ours is the present time, and elements ours only
as they exist. But whatever may be the operating
influences of our continent, no one can help seeing
that the Caucasian in America is undergoing a
change. Where it will ultimate, time only can determine,
but social conditions have already varied
its course. The combination of white master and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
negro slave has given it one direction, while general
individuality has given it another.</p>

<p>The French Celt of Lower Canada—now about a
million in his individual numbers—has already, at
the end of two centuries of American life, dwindled
into a pigmy compared with his European progenitors,
and the same is correspondingly true of the
Castilian of Peru and Mexico. Do these facts determine,
or rather, do they not throw shadows, on
the ultimate of that experiment now in the full tide
of its progress—the replanting of one continent with
a people who are alone indigenous to another?</p>

<p>Situated between these extremes—between Canada
on one side and Mexico on the other—is it probable
that nature to us will be more kind than she
has been to them. But evidences of changing natures
is already patent among us. Our American
men, say intelligent clothiers of our Northern cities,
are from two to three inches less around the chest
than are the Europeans. This is a significant fact.
But he who opens his eyes, and looks upon our
slender-waisted and light-muscled American women,
and compares them with the heavy-chested and
strong-armed women of Europe, will see even a
greater change. The European women are the
heaviest.</p>

<p>Men of science tell us that the Caucasian in America
loses a portion of that cellular cushion which
underlies the skin, or intervenes between it and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
what is called the aponeurosis; and that, as a consequence,
not only does the chest diminish, but the
face loses its fullness, the features sharpen, and the
system generally experiences a change. This may
be an immediate cause, for few facts are more patent
among us than the marked fullness of European,
and particularly of Teutonic faces; but for the
ultimate cause, there has not yet been given, or,
within our knowledge, even an attempted solution.</p>

<p>Facts thus patent are strongly suggestive of a
decline. But whatever they may be in reality, even
appearances were not always so. The American
man was not always below the measure of his European
progenitors, nor is he now so in all localities
and under all conditions of associated life. Our
American men of the Revolution “were larger and
stronger,” says Mr. Cobbett, an English writer of that
period, “than the British troops, and by that superiority
made,” he further says, the result of that
war “such as an English pen refuses to write.”
(<cite>Cobbett’s Advice to Young Men</cite>, §§275, 276 and
277.) This is European authority. But it stands
not alone, for we find it fortified in records of proportions,
which show our generals of that period,
with but one exception, to have been all above the
avoirdupois of two hundred pounds. Compare this
with the weight of our like officers of the present
day, and the superiority, of greater development,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
will be unhesitatingly accorded to the men of Revolutionary
times.</p>

<p>We learn of no distinctions then existing between
the different sections of our country, but on the
contrary, as the information reaches us, there is
room for no other conclusion than that every where
alike, our American men were “larger and stronger
than the British troops.” Such is the information
given us, but such are not the conditions now, for,
while the Northern man is reported to be of less
compass of body than the European, the men of
most, if not all, of that country lying south of Mason
and Dixon’s line, and above the feverish swamps
of the gulf and the Mississippi River, have kept up
to their Revolutionary standard. No one fact, concerning
our Western people, is more patent to the
observer on the banks of the Ohio River than the
fact, that the Kentuckians are larger, taller, and
heavier than the people of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois
who for eight hundred miles skirt their northern
border. The same is true of the Virginians. They
are larger, both in height and circumference than
their northern neighbors; and in every other Southern
State, with the exceptions above noticed, we
understand, that a similar development among the
higher orders of society exists.</p>

<p>An English tourist, who visited both the Northern
and Southern armies during the late war, observed
this greater development of the Southern men, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
so reported it for Blackwood’s Magazine. But the
fact is presented with probably more precision by
the records of the Smithsonian Institute, whose visitors,
for more than twenty years, have been weighed,
measured, and their nativities noted. These records,
say our informers, showed a difference, before the
war, of three inches in height and twenty pounds in
weight in favor of the Southern over the Northern
man.</p>

<p>Such facts can not too forcibly command the attention
of every man who aspires to the distinction
of making public laws. They show the men of the
South, at the beginning of the late war, in the same
proportions that they show the men of the whole
republic in the days of our revolution, when all the
States or colonies, North as well as South, held
negro slaves. To what cause, then, are we to impute
the greater development of the Anglo-American
at those particular times, and in those particular
localities, than to the institution of negro slavery?</p>

<p>But this development of the Americanized Caucasian
under the relation of white master and negro slave,
though a commanding fact in determining the application
of laws to localities, is nevertheless but little,
if any thing, more than a story half told; for in addition
to the greater physical proportions of the individual
man, the institution has given us our loftiest
shoots of intellectual power. It has given us a
Washington, a Jefferson, a Madison, and, as its limits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
were national in the dawning period of our republic,
an Adams, a Hamilton, a Franklin, and, in
fact, almost every other intellect of which the nation
is justly proud. It was this institution which gave
lofty manhood to the American mind, and threw the
glove of defiance at the feet of the great Herculian
English power. It gave birth to a nation of freemen,
and when cut down in its limits by Northern
folly, fanaticism, and design, its remaining noblemen,
with but one third of the republic in population,
for half a century gave direction to it all.
They were giants in debate, and by their superiority,
in the clash of sections, stung the pride of the opinionated
Yankee, who, brooding over his wounds,
sought that redress in the physical clash of numbers
which he could not obtain in the battle of mind.
Then, when Northern numbers, swelled by immigration
to overpowering proportions, he, in the true
spirit of a low cunning, discovered that “The Union
was no longer worth a <em>cus</em> without the letting of a
little blood;” and, as a consequence, hurried on—in
his security of numbers—his vaunted “Irrepressible
conflict of contending and induring forces.”</p>

<p>There could be no retreat from a conflict “irrepressible”
in its nature. The child begotten must
be born, and when defiance responds to aggression,
there must come the shock of arms. It did come,
and with a force that now tells the world of the
madness in which it was conceived. Armies have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
met and have fought. The storm of war has passed
over the nation, and beneath its debris now lies the
American man, overcome and subdued, not by individual
superiority, but by the force of mighty numbers—the
madmen of his own country, in alliance
with a world of immigrants and imported mercenaries,
arrayed in arms against him. It was a conflict
of unequal numbers and resources. Still it was
a mighty struggle, for it was that shock in which
“comes the tug of war.”</p>

<p>The American man, who fought his battles alone,
went down, but he fell, as he ever falls, from the
lakes to the gulf, “with his back to the ground and
his feet to the foe.” With a population of but five
millions, and but poorly provided, he disputed, for
four long and bloody years, every inch of ground,
against the twenty-five millions, who, with all the engines
of modern warfare, and with all Europe at their
command for soldiers, hurled their mighty armies
against him. But he fell, and why should he not
have fallen, when the herring is known to have
smothered the whale?</p>

<p>The native Indian was brave and undaunted—no
Roman was his superior, until he was cowed and
subdued by the superiority of the bayonet and bomb
over his war-club and his arrows. He met his
doom, resigned and unshaken, as fate determined it,
and so, too, now does his Anglo-successor—a proof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
in nature that the American man is designed for a
soldier and a master, and not for a serf or slave.</p>

<p>The transplanted European in America may lose
a portion of his cellular tissue, under one form of
association, and may regain it, or expand it, under
another; the cause of which may not readily be
comprehended. But there is one point, not of proportions,
but of physical action, resulting from some
cause, known or unknown, and alike common to all
forms of association, which can not, we think, impress
itself too forcibly on the mind of every
American legislator. It is the undeniable fact, that
the Anglo-American man has not the same endurance,
as a drudge or laborer, that pertains to the
European—that he is less enduring, and, as a consequence,
in labor’s conflict, loses ground. He is more
fleet, and may do more for a time, but at the end
of the year the European will, as a general rule,
subject, of course, to its exceptions, make the best
report.</p>

<p>By this superiority is the American forced from
the field of labor, and his place monopolized by the
immigrant from abroad. Look around you, and see
who do your work! Look to your railroads and
canals; look through your workshops, to your various
modes of transportation, and your menial services,
and when you have done so, tell me if you can
keep up a supply, or even man a single boat on the
Western waters, without the aid of immigrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
hands. Business, in fact, would stop in almost
every department, requiring heavy labor, if the European
man was taken away. Is not this a dependence
reaching to the very foundation of that liberty
of which the Americans, more than any other people,
are most prolific in their boasts? Can a people be
free who are dependent on another people, equals
with themselves before the law, for all the necessaries
which labor alone can produce? Mexico bows
to a master from abroad; and the United States,
through the folly of her legislators, now leans dependent
on foreign hands.</p>

<p>Labor, in the conflict of life, draws to itself the
capital of that country in which its productions are
used, or to the hands which produce them; consequently,
when a society is composed of two kinds, or
divisions of people, one of whom are better, or more
enduring laborers than the other, that division, so
favored, will, sooner or later, obtain the property,
and with it political and social dominion of the
nation.</p>

<p>Already is our property in rapid transit from native
to immigrated hands, and we, even rejoicing at
the opportunities which circumstances give us, of
selling or giving our country away. Look around you,
and see who are vendors and who are purchasers of
real estate, and the point will at once become palpable
and plain. See, too, who are becoming landlords,
and who are becoming tenants; and, under the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
order of things—outside of that combination of
wholesale swindlers who converted our property
into national securities, and then stole to their fullness—who
are the holders of our national bonds?
Look at them here and abroad, as they are now
sporting on property wrenched from American
hands, and you may have some idea of the condition
into which you are driving your nation.</p>

<p>The political tendency is no less marked than the
transition of estates, and may by as simple an effort
be disclosed. You can try it by the same rule, no
matter what may be your party relations. If you be
a democrat, try and elect even a constable in any
ward of any city of the United States without first
consulting your Irish supports, and then see the
point at which your efforts will end. Or if you be
a republican, and think your condition more tolerable,
try the same “experiment” without in like
manner first asking permission of “my German
friends,” and when you have ended the trial let us
know the end of the horn at which you made your
exit. You know that you can not so elect, therefore
are you humbled to influences from abroad.</p>

<p>Such are conditions before the ballot. Americans
no longer masters of their own position. But
what are conditions behind it?</p>

<p>When you wanted revenue, you unhesitatingly imposed
a duty of two dollars on a gallon of whisky;
but when you came to lager beer, you very modestly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
stopped at the short figures of three cents on the gallon.
Why did you do so? We will not venture an
answer for you; but, as Americans make whisky, and
Germans make lager beer, we have no trouble in seeing
who are favored, and who are oppressed. The
American man, and particularly the Western one,
whipped out of his independence, submits to whatever
you dare to impose. But Deitrich is not quite so pliable.
He waits upon <em>his servants</em> in force. This he did
with his various committees, while his servants were
imposing duties, and, shaking his fingers in their faces,
with a leer of the eye, and a significant turn of the
mouth, said: “You must not dax te lager peer!”
What then followed? Deitrich knew his power,
and Mr. Congressman his dependence—both, of
course, alike manly, unterrified, and impartial. But
when the bill came forth, we found a tax of two dollars
on whisky and three cents on beer. Further
comment might be disrespectful.</p>

<p>In this picture may you see your condition. Deprived
of your own laborer, and made dependent
on laborers from abroad, you are passing into
subjugation almost as fast as you transformed four
millions of useful negroes into four millions of
vagabonds.</p>

<p>Why are you thus hastening downward? It is
because you have drank of foreign ideas until you
have become frenzied, and, in an apish vanity of
foreign things, have turned your backs on advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
which the God of nature, has, during the whole of
your existence, been arduously forcing upon you.</p>

<p>He prepared your country for a great purpose,
brought it forth at the proper period of time, and
made it the joint receptacle of two great species of
the genus man—the one a race of masters, the other
a race of subordinates or slaves.</p>

<p>To the subordinate, in his subordinate condition,
he gave an increase of physical power, and to the
superior whom he deprived of some portion of his
laborious indurance, that he might be charitable and
humane, gave a high-toned manhood, an undaunted
spirit, and, for the privation which he imposed, gave
him the subordinate hands with which to do his
labor. Thus, in this, as in all other things, is he
alike good in what he gives and in what he denies.
But you, in your spite or vanity, have rejected his
blessings.</p>

<p>Our Northern system—now made national—is but
the European system in all its material phases, and
under its present character—equality of whites and
blacks, States reduced to dependencies, power centralized,
bond-holding lords sapping the labor of the
people, and the foreign mind controlling interior
forces—is probably little, if any thing, more or less
than the European system botched or spoiled. It is
a system under which men of fortune, having their
wealth in money, seek the localities in which profit
and luxury unite, and as the poor, the menial, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
the artful, like the mistletoe, draw their succor from
larger boughs, they, too, congregate around the same
centers, and thus are made up great cities which, under
a political and social view, have very justly been
characterized as great sores.</p>

<p>But it is not so where the institution of white
master and negro slave exists, for there the same
law of self-interest works to a different end. Wealth
existing in slaves, the owner selects that order of
life in which his property may be best protected and
yield him the best return; consequently he eschews
the city, and settles down on a plantation where
both he and his negroes are alike protected against
the contaminating influences of congregated luxury,
poverty, and vice. For these reasons have penitentiaries
been few, and poorhouses scarcely known in
the Southern States, while both have been numerous
and crowded from their cellars to their garrets in
the North.</p>

<p>Why, then, have you destroyed negro slavery?
and I particularly use the word negro, for no white
blood should ever be held in such bondage. Are
you madmen, or knaves sacrificing your country for
party ends, or have you dropped from the high mentalities
of your fathers down to a generation of fools?</p>

<p>Spite is a fierce motive power in the human mind,
and when it breaks forth from a long pent up fountain,
it comes forth with terrific power. So, we fear,
has it been in our time. The tory, who fell with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Lord North in 1776, rose again with Abraham Lincoln
in 1860; and writhing under the stings of long
defeat, found no bounds to his vengeance. He
therefore, in the consummation of his “irrepressible
conflict,” wanted “a little blood.”</p>

<p>But let us not be misunderstood or inappropriate
in the application of names to conditions.</p>

<p>The tory has a character by which he may be
known under all disguises, as effectually as the ass
was known by his bray when clothed in the skin of
the lion. He is generally a worshiper of money,
and to get it and hold it to himself and his children
forever, to keep the rich rich, and the poor poor, or,
in his own language, to steady the ship of state,
he seeks a <em>centralization</em> of power in a <em>congress</em> or
in a <em>crown</em>.</p>

<p>He is the man who sees all national perfections
abroad, and all imperfections at home; the man who
tells you that “England did so and so”—that England
abolished slavery—that England has a great
national debt—that England has a subjugated Ireland,
and that we, of necessity, to be great must be
just like England. These points alone mark the tory.
He is a centralizationist and British in his proclivities.
But he has other stripes, ear-marks, and
croppings by which he may be known. He is the
man who governs by fraud or force, who sees wisdom
in deception, and honesty as a twin sister of
ignorance, and vulgar life—he is often artfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
pious; but runs the nation wildly into debt, converts
its property into national bonds, then steals them or
divides them with his friends without the least compunction
of conscience, but is shockingly horrified
if some one happens to say repudiation, or, no more
high tariffs, stamp duties, or excise taxes. He is
often exceedingly reverential, but very forgetful
when new desires conflict with old obligations. He
goes into a Know-nothing lodge, swears immortal
hatred to all foreigners, and particularly to that
division of our species whom he has politely styled
“the d—d Dutch,” and also in the same obligation
swears unchanging fidelity to his native brother, but,
on the next day, joins in a crusade with these very
identical “d—d Dutch” to murder and destroy those
very men whom, on the day preceding, he as arduously
swore ever to defend and never to desert.</p>

<p>He is the man who steals the goods, and then
diverts attention by crying “stop thief!”—the man
who has revolutionized our government, without incurring
the responsibility of a rebellion.</p>

<p>His views vary exceedingly under the influence
of the stand-point which he occupies as a member
of the <em>ins</em> or of the <em>outs</em>. Under one condition, he
sees the bonds of our federal Union as “a league
with hell and a covenant with death,” and, in some
individualities, “struggles for sixteen years to get
fifteen States out of it.” But under the other, he
becomes more <em>Union</em> than Union itself—runs forth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
with his mouth wide open, shouting his devotions
with all the power of his lungs, and with a rope in
his hand to hang all persons whose roaring capacities
are not equal to his own.</p>

<p>He also, under one condition, sees our “star-spangled
banner” as “a flaunting lie,” and a “hated
rag.” But under the other, lashes himself into a
blazing fury, and breathes forth blood, and murder,
and annihilation against his own countrymen—but
not against foreigners—who dare to insult that time-honored
emblem of a great nation’s pride, liberty
and honor.</p>

<p>He is the man who divided our country into two
party sections, because he had power in the one and
not in the other; then held his Convention at Chicago,
and, as a war challenge to the other section, nominated
his candidates in a wigwam, with a bowie-knife
eight feet long, hanging over his speaker’s chair.</p>

<p>He is the man who converted the pulpit into a
political rostrum, and from it, in the name of religion,
preached politics and sectarian and sectional
spite.</p>

<p>He is the man who is always humble in defeat,
but who, when successful, never gets done kicking a
fallen foe.</p>

<p>He changes nature (in his own estimation) by
changing names; but is here no way punctilious in
regard to proprieties. He says “<em>Colored</em> People”—can’t
say Negro, for that would be paying too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
respect to nature’s divisions; therefore, he adopts,
and clings to the prefix <em>colored</em>, though his philosophy
of light tells him that black is not a color, but
the absorption of all colors and the reflection of none.
If he were honest he would here pause; but the deception
is the very thing which alone sweetens the
morsel to his tongue: for, by saying “colored people,”
he may so work on the imagination of some
fool, as to make him believe, that all that divides the
negro from the Caucasian is merely the exterior
shade or color of his skin.</p>

<p>He is deceptious and often pretentiously pious;
but, in addition to both, is excessively malignant,
and hates from the very bottom of his soul, wherein
is generated the deepest spite, which, in its struggle
for vent from its dark-vaulted, heaving and burning
interior, bursts forth with such fulminations as
“Copperhead” and “Locofoco.” They are the
effusions of his own soul—display his own character,
and, by their escape, give him relief.</p>

<p>He was for the Union when the Southern States
wished to get out of it; and against the Union when
they wished to be counted in. Thus is he a good
Christian—by being all things to all men.</p>

<p>He is sufficiently variable to be counted among
the progressive species; for, like his brother, the
dandy, he changes his clothing with every change of
fashion. At one time he is a federal, at another a
national republican, at another a whig, at another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
a republican without a prefix, and at another, <em>par
excellence</em>, a Union man. Thus does he change, in
his exterior, with times and fashions. But follow
him back to his nakedness, and you will always
find him a centralizationists, and an admirer of
English polity, or an English church, or an English
crown. He will be somewhere lurking under the
curtain, and, although the way be dark and mysterious,
wherever you hear the spiteful utterances of
“Copperhead” or “Locofoco,” or kindred fulminations,
or the soft and plaintive whispers of “Colored
People,” you may know that you are in the right
course to that dark nucleus of many exteriors
known to our revolutionary dialect as the American
tory.</p>

<p>This explains what we mean by a term which
otherwise might be regarded as improper or inappropriate
in these connections. But let us return
from so long a digression.</p>

<p>Our bird of liberty has already flown to the mountains,
and left us, not independent, as we are wont
to be, but dependent—dependent for American labor
on European hands, and through that dependence
and other kindred relations—the result of kindred
policies—subject to the European mind in our
affairs of State. This is all the result of unwise
legislation. But it began long anterior to present
time; still to you has been reserved the infliction of
the most fatal of all inflicted blows. You have, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
already noticed, converted four millions of laborers
into four millions of vagabonds—have transformed
or inverted them from a natural to an unnatural condition,
and there left them to pay the penalty of your
own crimes, by a rapid decline and ultimate extinction.
You have forced our American youth to unequal
competition in the field of labor, and not contented
with holding our delicate-muscled American
women—the most beautiful, I have not a doubt,
beneath the sun, and designed by nature for ladies
to command—to an unequal conflict with the heavy
armed laboring woman of the old world; but you
have forced them to a still more unequal and
degraded conflict with the gross and insensitive
negroes, yet wavering between imposed civilization
and native barbarism.</p>

<p>You have destroyed our own kindred that you
may give their lands away to immigrants from
abroad—to a people of another continent, who even
now darken the seas with their numbers, on their
ways to receive and appropriate to themselves homes
made desolate by your destruction of American
men, women, and children. You will not deny the
impeachment, but will interpose your plea of loyalty—the
plea of the tory over three quarters of a
century ago—but can you hide the fact that, <em>had
there been no abolitionists there would have been no
secessionists or secession</em>?</p>

<p>But the battle is over, and we may now count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the loss, and in the sequel see how effectually
your blows have rebounded to the injury of all
sections, both North and South. You have destroyed
a million of our most valuable men, and imposed
upon us a debt of three thousand millions of
dollars—the heaviest burden, computing its interest
at but six percent, while England’s draws but three,
that now bears on any people in the known world.
But even this, though great beyond indurance, for
neither principal nor interest ever can be paid, is
not the greatest of the afflictions which you have
imposed upon us: you have destroyed the unity of
sections, and killed our own goose that laid our
golden eggs. This a few figures will effectually
explain.</p>

<p>Take for elucidation, of American commerce and
production, any one year, when nature was unobstructed
by the clash of arms, and it will unfold, not
only the suicidal nature of your policy, but the great
fountain out of which has flown American wealth
and prosperity. Take, for example, the year 1859,
the year preceding the tory rise and the American
fall, and it will elucidate the point in question.</p>

<p>The whole agricultural exports—the only reliable
foundation of our national prosperity—of that year
were, in round numbers, just $199,000,000, of that
sum $161,000,000 was cotton, and $21,000,000 tobacco,
leaving but $17,000,000 as the whole export
of our cereals and provisions of that year. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
whole sum of Northern exports would not now pay
Ohio’s share of the interest on the national debt.
How then is she to pay taxes and support life when
the currency of the country, now blown into a froth,
shall again have settled down to a solidity? She
can not pay; nor can any other State not upheld
by arbitrary laws, robbing other people for her
benefit.</p>

<p>In two years out of three, and probably three out
of four, the Baltic and Black Sea, with their cereals
and provisions, can undersell us in the markets of
Western Europe, consequently a reliance on a direct
trade of our northern productions with countries
beyond our own, would be so uncertain as to leave
us two years out of three, and probably three out of
four, in a condition almost as helpless as if we had
raised nothing above our own consumptive wants.</p>

<p>Under such conditions one half of the Northwest
would probably relapse into a wilderness—into that
condition into which it would undoubtedly have remained
had your policy began with the history of
the nation. But our conditions have been of a very
different character, and until disturbed by madmen,
were, I have not a doubt, the best regulated for the
production of national prosperity that any where
existed upon the face of the world.</p>

<p>The Northwest was the cereal garden of the
South. We fed the negro while he raised cotton;
thus our productions went into the bale, and with it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
or of it, were exported to Europe, and there sold
for money. This sent a stream of gold across the
ocean, which spread over all our country, nourishing
our corn-producing fields of the North, as well
as the cotton fields of the southern plantations.
This was the fountain of our prosperity. It brought
the best market in the world to our western doors,
and among its consequences forced out a stream of
emigration from abroad which set into our country to
head the golden tide which, by American labor alone,
under American regulations, preceded it. But now,
this stream is already more than half dried up, and
still diminishing in its volume.</p>

<p>What, then, unless some specialty, as a foreign famine
or European war, comes to our relief, is to be our
future? Our old channels of commerce broken up—our
great American staple vastly reduced in its
volume—our corn without a market in the world—a
mountain of debt bearing down upon us—a tax on
every thing around us, on all we eat, and drink, and
wear—and a revenue stamp demanded wherever a
stamp can be made to stick;—our people, like their
prosperity, by force of institutions, on the decline,
and Europe, both internally and externally, exerting
a moving influence on our nation! Does not
the fate of Mexico already look down upon us? and
will not some future Napoleon send to us some future
Maximilian to collect interests on United States
bonds, as well as the present one now does on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
bonds of Mexico? Is any result more certain, if
your present wild and senseless policy be continued
and pursued?</p>

<p>Europe, with reference to humanity, is the great
positive pole of the world. Her waves radiate from
a center, and have swept, and will continue to sweep
around the earth, unless, in the combination of elements,
new barriers be formed that will break her
surges and roll back her billows. This has been
done in America, and, by its power, forced the dominion
of European kings from American shores.
It was done by the unity of two elements directly
opposite in their natures—the Caucasian and the
negro; the one as subordinate, and the other as supreme.
But the moment this unity has been severed,
the ramparts of the state have weakened, and
foreign waves have again broken in upon us.</p>

<p>What, then, shall we do in the advancement of
our own greatness, or in the defense of our own
rights and liberties? Shall we, like stupid toads,
lend a suppliant ear to the siren songs of distant
royalty, and extinguish ourselves in an apish
effort to duplicate some other people? Or shall
we not rise, in the dignity of our Revolutionary
independence, and conform our society to the
requisitions of nature at home. This, if you be
wise, you will do—you will, with some modifications
of past systems, re-establish negro slavery; and,
instead of giving your country away—retreating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
before new tides, and beckoning for new invasions
in the name of immigrations—you will re-open the
slave-trade, and bring your laborers from the coast
of Africa. Then you will have a laboring power of
your own—a power which you can transmit, with
your lands, to your children—and so protect the
generations which are to follow you, against that
dependence with which the youth of the present age
are sorely oppressed.</p>

<p>Then you will have your social laws based on
nature’s laws, and each man, with his species, in his
appropriate condition, enjoying the highest measure
of civil liberty that nature and good government
can, by possibility, afford. Then will America be
free, and her sons, in reality, independent. Then
will they roll back the tide of foreign insolence,
presumption and dictation. Then will they have a
national character; and, standing to their arms as
soldiers, drilled to the military art, protect their
rights, their laws, and their liberties against whomsoever
may dare to intrude.</p>

but on reflection he has concluded, that, inasmuch
as the prayer of the petition reaches beyond Congress,

<p>For this reason the paper will be placed in the hands
of some publisher, as soon as one can be procured, and

<p>Publishers and readers who wish to interest themselves

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
